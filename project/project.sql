Clearly,&amp;nbsp;this is a project aimed at affirming the allegiance of the ruling dispensation to the&amp;nbsp;father of the nation and what he stood for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet, the Bhartiya Janata Party has an elected representative in the Lok Sabha who unabashedly&amp;nbsp;lauds&amp;nbsp;Gandhi&rsquo;s assassin as a patriot, not just outside the house but now inside as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To recall, the person in question &lt;a href=&quot;https://thewire.in/politics/pragya-thaku-bjp-narendra-modi-defence-panel&quot;&gt;continues to be accused of terrorism&lt;/a&gt; in the Malegaon bomb blast case of 2008 under the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the collective outrage of the opposition, and indeed of patriotic Indians across the board who identify the&amp;nbsp;struggle&amp;nbsp;for independence from British rule with Gandhi&rsquo;s&amp;nbsp;leadership and Gandhian values, the BJP remains reluctant to take forthright action against&amp;nbsp;Thakur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is&amp;nbsp;remarkable that provenly patriotic political leaders in Kashmir&amp;nbsp;have been put away, lest they may express views&amp;nbsp;that embarrass the&amp;nbsp; government, while&amp;nbsp;a BJP member&amp;nbsp; seems to remain at liberty,&amp;nbsp;repeatedly, to&amp;nbsp; hold Gandhi&rsquo;s murderer up as a patriot. A fine gloss indeed on the current government&rsquo;s&amp;nbsp;take on freedom of speech, which clearly seems a right, however &ldquo;fundamental,&rdquo;&amp;nbsp; to be granted selectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is it not a travesty of grave proportions that&amp;nbsp;a Farooq Abdullah or Omar Abdullah&amp;nbsp;who have stood by the accession of the erstwhile&amp;nbsp; state to India through&amp;nbsp;thick and thin, and often at real and present physical danger to their lives, should come to be regarded&amp;nbsp;as greater destabilisers of the realm&amp;nbsp;than a Pragya Thakur who thinks nothing of eulogising the murderer of the father of the nation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fact of the matter is that, like Donald Trump in America, the right-wing in India has an appeasement compulsion. Just as Trump pays tactical&amp;nbsp;obeisance to the&amp;nbsp;framers of the US constitution and to its egalitarian values that forbid discrimination on the basis of race but then goes on to shore up his core conservative racist base with not-so-inaudible dog-whistles, Hindutva forces at home require lip-service to Gandhi&amp;nbsp;while&amp;nbsp;simultaneously also&amp;nbsp;shoring up a not-so-silent&amp;nbsp;regard for&amp;nbsp;Gandhi&rsquo;s&amp;nbsp;murderer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This ugly conundrum prevents the current rulers from demonstrably rejecting any of its clan who choose to make&amp;nbsp;bold and overt their dislike of the Gandhian project of inter-communal harmony and inclusive nationhood.&amp;nbsp;The only option it has is to protest insincerely against&amp;nbsp;those averments and take token measures of disapproval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rightist media spokespersons can now be heard acknowledging with pride that Pragya Singh was given a ticket to enter parliament in order to give electoral legitimacy to someone who has been accused of being a terrorist agent of the Hindutva right-wing. Having won her seat by a whopping margin, both the nation at large and the law-enforcement agencies are meant to understand that no Hindu can ever be a terrorist.&amp;nbsp;Such an accomplishment then encourages us to view Godse in a light different from the one in which he has been viewed so far.&amp;nbsp;Praise for Godse&amp;nbsp;as a patriot is thus a&amp;nbsp;well-thought-out project to mainstream&amp;nbsp;acts of&amp;nbsp;heinous violence by Hindutva protagonists as acts committed on behalf of the authentic nation that&amp;nbsp;the secularists refused to respect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any stringent action against her &ndash; like expulsion from the party &ndash; then entails the risk of contravening&amp;nbsp;that desired reading of Hindutva violence &ndash; a thought anathema to&amp;nbsp;the project of stereotyping only Muslims as perpetrators of terrorism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In passing, the Hindutva project of mainstreaming Godse invites us to de-hyphenate the greatness of his &ldquo;nationalist&rdquo; (read anti-Muslim) thought from his unfortunate&amp;nbsp;act of homicide.&amp;nbsp; Curiously, this sort of tolerant courtesy is not to be extended&amp;nbsp;to individuals on the Left or of other religions who might&amp;nbsp;also genuinely think their thoughts for the nation to be for its greater glory and commit murder.&amp;nbsp;In their case, the thought and the action are to be seen as intrinsically intertwined. Not so in the case of the &ldquo;nationalist&rdquo; Godse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although one consistent and successful ploy of the right-wing has been to label the Indian National Congress and broad sections of the progressive&amp;nbsp;political formations in India as &lsquo;Muslim-appeasers&rsquo;, the fact is that the clout of the Hindutva forces lies in its appeasement of a sectarian Hindu vote bank that not only&amp;nbsp;holds&amp;nbsp; all Muslims responsible for Partition but refuses the claim of the millions who&amp;nbsp;chose to stick to their Indianness, since their chief place of religious pilgrimage lies outside the boundaries of the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regarding as they do India to be a Hindu nation, the Hindutva ideologues hold that a charge of appeasement of Hindus cannot hold water since they&lt;i&gt;&amp;nbsp;are&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;the nation itself, whereas Muslims threaten that construction of nationhood and deserve to be subjugated as &ldquo;alien&rdquo; Muslim rulers allegedly subjugated &ldquo;Hindu&rdquo; India for centuries on end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pragya Singh is thus&amp;nbsp;of fundamental symbolic value to the Hindutva right-wing, and proceeding against her with conviction &ndash; as allegiance to constitutional values may so dictate &ndash; would knock the ideological basis of its politics out of gear.&lt;/p&gt;', 1, '2019-12-08 18:14:49'),
(19, 12, 4, 'Pragya Thakur: BJPâ€™s Original Sin Was to Make Her an MP', '1575809313_0002.jpg', '&lt;p&gt;The opposition is up in arms, and rightly so, at the Modi government&rsquo;s decision to make Pragya Thakur &ndash; the BJP MP from Bhopal who has been chargesheeted in a serious terrorist offence &ndash; a member of parliament&rsquo;s consultative committee on defence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apart from the irony of putting a person accused of terrorism in a panel that reviews the functioning of the Ministry of Defence and looks at broad questions of national security, Thakur is also on record hailing Independent India&rsquo;s first terrorist, Nathuram Godse, as a &lsquo;&lt;a href=&quot;https://thewire.in/politics/pragya-thakur-nathuram-godse-patriot-statement-bjp&quot;&gt;patriot&lt;/a&gt;&rsquo;. Godse assassinated Mahatma Gandhi and Thakur is a fan of the assassin. How can such a person be in parliament, and now, on the consultative committee on defence?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The answer, in two words: Narendra Modi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We know that it was Narendra Modi who gave Thakur a BJP ticket for the Lok Sabha election and I&rsquo;m going to stick my neck out and say that Thakur&rsquo;s membership of the prestigious parliamentary committee would not have been possible without the express authorisation of the prime minister.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I say this because Modi had said, back in May, during the election campaign, &lt;a href=&quot;https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/elections/lok-sabha/india/cant-forgive-pragya-for-godse-deshbhakt-remark-says-modi/articleshow/69373599.cms&quot;&gt;that he could never forgive Thakur&lt;/a&gt; for her comments on Gandhi and Godse. His rebuke was rather mild, to be frank, but going by Modi&rsquo;s track record of never criticising his &lt;i&gt;parivar&lt;/i&gt;&rsquo;s folks for the communal, misogynist, casteist and just plain crazy comments they make all the time, it was clear that he was letting it be known that he disapproved of what Thakur had done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So knowing the way the BJP and the Modi government work, is it possible some minion in the Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs would have dared to put a person that Modi had criticised in this fashion on to this committee? Absolutely not. The proposal would have definitely moved up for his clearance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is also quite possible that Modi in his new &ndash; 2.0 &ndash; avatar, with the election campaign and its requirement of propriety behind him, actively suggested Thakur be given this honour. After all, Modi actively floated the proposal during the recent Maharashtra assembly election that V.D. Savarkar be given the Bharat Ratna. This is the same Savarkar who was put on trial for being part of the conspiracy to assassinate Gandhi. &lt;a href=&quot;https://thewire.in/history/savarkar-gandhi-assassination&quot;&gt;Savarkar was acquitted&lt;/a&gt; but the fact is that he told Nathuram Godse in Marathi &ndash; &lt;i&gt;&lsquo;Yashasvi Houn Ya&lt;/i&gt;&rsquo; &ndash; &lsquo;Be successful and come back&rsquo; &ndash; as the assassin was setting out from Savarkar Sadan in Bombay for Delhi on his final mission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modi&rsquo;s favourite politician, Sardar Patel, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/how-savarkar-escaped-the-gallows/article4358048.ece&quot;&gt;had this to say&lt;/a&gt; about the conspiracy in a letter to Nehru on February 27, 1948:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&ldquo;I have kept myself almost in daily touch with the progress of the investigation regarding Bapu&rsquo;s assassination case&hellip; It was a fanatical wing of the Hindu Mahasabha directly under Savarkar that [hatched] the conspiracy and saw it through.&rdquo;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Savarkar, Godse and Pragya&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, anyone with even a basic understanding of politics knows that you cannot be an admirer of Savarkar and his cult without also getting contaminated by his association with Nathuram Godse. Of course, this is an inconvenient connection for any respectable politician, so hardly anyone at any level of seniority in the Sangh parivar will ever openly speak favourably about Gandhi&rsquo;s assassin. Thakur felt she was low enough down the saffron food chain &lt;a href=&quot;https://thewire.in/politics/pragya-thakur-nathuram-godse-patriot-statement-bjp&quot;&gt;to speak her mind&lt;/a&gt;. &ldquo;Godse was a deshbhakt, is a deshbhakt and will remain a deshbhakt. People calling him a terrorist should instead look within, such people will be given a fitting reply in the election,&rdquo; she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier, &lt;a href=&quot;https://thewire.in/politics/elections-2019-bjp-hemant-karkare-sadhvi-pragya-thakur&quot;&gt;she had praised the terrorists who attacked Mumbai&lt;/a&gt; in 2008 for unleashing &ldquo;karma&rdquo; or divine retribution and killing Hemant Karkare, head of the Maharashtra police anti-terror squad and the officer whose investigative work had led to her arrest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pragya Thakur&rsquo;s comments on Godse came at a bad moment for the BJP as the election campaign was in full swing, so the party quickly distanced itself from her view. Party president Amit Shah announced the BJP would take disciplinary action against her in 10 days, and Modi too made his &lt;a href=&quot;https://thewire.in/politics/narendra-modi-pragya-thakur-nathuram-godse&quot;&gt;now-famous remark&lt;/a&gt; that he could never ever forgive Thakur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of this was clearly humbug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First of all, no one bothered to notice that Thakur &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxBddRtmrxA&quot;&gt;did not really apologise&lt;/a&gt; for her appalling comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;My statement was not to hurt anyone&rsquo;s feelings. If it has hurt anybody&rsquo;s feelings then I apologise. What Gandhi Ji has done for the country cannot be forgotten. I respect him a lot,&rdquo; she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So the apology was only if anyone&rsquo;s feelings had been hurt by what she said. She then uttered some faint words of praise for Gandhi but did not withdraw her remark calling his assassin a deshbhakt. Moreover, she accused the media of distorting her remarks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only did Thakur not apologise, Shah&rsquo;s promise of disciplinary action was also eyewash.&lt;/p&gt;', 1, '2019-12-08 18:18:33'),

This also prevented outsiders from buying land, owning property or applying for jobs in Jammu and Kashmir.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On August 5, the Centre read down both the Constitutional provisions and bifurcated the state into the two Union Territories of J&amp;amp;K and Ladakh. The two units came into existence on October 31.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kumar said in the past four months since Article 370 was read down, SIDCO has received Expressions of Interest (EoI) from at least 39 outside companies. These companies, according to the official, have shown interest in investing in different sectors in J&amp;amp;K, including apple industry, cold storages, dry fruit and saffron industries, and tourism and hotel industries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;All of them have submitted detailed project proposals, including land required, to set up their businesses,&rdquo; said Kumar. &ldquo;But things are at the preliminary stage and so far, no project has been cleared.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reading down of Article 370 has led to fear within the Kashmir Valley that BJP was working on a design to change the demography of the Muslim majority J&amp;amp;K. The mainstream parties have also repeatedly echoed similar concerns in the past four months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BJP has tried to allay these fears.

Senior BJP leader from Jammu, Nirmal Singh has pitched for the introduction of a domicile law like in Himachal Pradesh and north eastern states to protect the land and job rights of the people of J&amp;amp;K.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;Soon, we are going to propose a domicile-like option for citizens of Jammu and Kashmir.

Like in Himachal Pradesh and Punjab, agricultural land cannot be bought,&rdquo; Singh, who was the deputy chief minister in the previous PDP-BJP government, told a news channel in the wake of the Article 370 decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A senior official of the rank of secretary in J&amp;amp;K administration said the government wants to first create a &ldquo;land bank&rdquo; before opening doors for the outside investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;The good thing is that investors are now showing interest to enter Jammu and Kashmir. This wasn&rsquo;t the case earlier,&rdquo; said the official. &ldquo;Once some companies start their operations in J&amp;amp;K, it will encourage other investors to follow.

But 43 of them didn&rsquo;t survive, while the rest are in critical condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kishor Singh, medical superintendent at LNJP Hospital, told ThePrint that the primary cause of death was suffocation due to plastic and foam fumes, and said this was also why the injured people were still critical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;Inhalation cases may become severe with passing time, as it causes swelling in lungs,&rdquo; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LNJP Hospital authorities said 30 of the people brought to them were dead on arrival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Former Delhi Fire Service director&amp;nbsp;G.C. Mishra added that while the fire itself was not a major one, the casualty count was unusually high because of the inhalation of poisonous gases by the victims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;If you inhale the smoke from a one-foot-long plastic-coated wire burned inside a room for five minutes, it is enough to kill you,&rdquo; Mishra told ThePrint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added that Delhi Fire Service Rules, 2010, and the National Building Code of India apply to new buildings, not to the structures in areas like Anaj Mandi, most of which were built between the 1920s and the 1960s. He said small fires were common in the locality, which hosts several illegal factories and adjoins other congested areas like Filmistan and Sadar Bazar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Panic among relatives&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the LNJP Hospital, there was utter chaos through the day as relatives of the labourers killed in the blaze rushed to identify their kin among the dead and injured.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the labourers hailed from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Praveen, a resident of Sitamarhi, said his brother Mukesh was working in a plastic handbag factory on one of the floors, and that there were at least three to four factories on every floor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;I got a call from his fellow worker that he has in the building last night, but I don&rsquo;t know where he has been taken to,&rdquo; Praveen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Compensation for victims&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the central and Delhi governments have announced relief packages for the relatives of those killed or injured in the blaze.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister Narendra Modi has announced an ex gratia of Rs 2 lakh each for the kin of those killed, and Rs 50,000 each for those seriously injured, the PMO said in a tweet. The amount will be paid from the Prime Minister&rsquo;s National Relief Fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Delhi government has ordered a probe into the fire, and sought a detailed report within seven days. Revenue minister Kailash Gahlot has directed the district magistrate (central) to conduct the inquiry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has announced a compensation of Rs 10 lakh each for the families of the deceased, and Rs 1 lakh each to those injured. The expense of medical treatment of those injured will be borne by the Delhi government.&lt;/p&gt;', 1, '2019-12-08 21:19:45'),
(24, 13, 18, 'Encounter Killings Will Not Make Women Safer From Sexual Violence', '1575822429_NHRC-Hyderabad-encounter-1200x472.jpg', '&lt;p&gt;On December 6, 2019, the Telangana police declared that &ldquo;the law has done its duty&rdquo;, referring to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://thewire.in/government/hyderabad-vet-rape-accused-killed-police&quot;&gt;alleged &lsquo;encounter&rsquo; of four persons&lt;/a&gt; suspected of raping and murdering a 26-year-old veterinarian in Hyderabad. Police officials of several other states have lauded and endorsed the Telangana police&rsquo;s actions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Telangana police&rsquo;s account provides no explanation for why the suspects were taken out without handcuffs at 3 am, or how four unarmed men managed to overpower ten armed policepersons This is &lt;i&gt;prima facie &lt;/i&gt;a case of custodial murder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://thewire.in/politics/telangana-rape-accused-encounter-response&quot;&gt;Widespread condonation&lt;/a&gt; of the use of violence in the name of women&rsquo;s safety is a distraction from finding real and just solutions to ending violence against women. Most recently, the reports of a rape victim &lt;a href=&quot;https://thewire.in/women/unnao-rape-victim-set-ablaze-by-the-accused-passes-away&quot;&gt;being set ablaze&lt;/a&gt; by her perpetrators in broad daylight in Unnao show us that the police have failed to protect victims while they are still alive. The rape victim succumbed to her injuries on Friday night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Police &ldquo;encounters&rdquo; shift the focus away from the systemic failure of institutions in discharging their duties effectively in the first place. In the present case, there is no way to even know whether the suspects were &lt;a href=&quot;https://thewire.in/rights/hyderabad-police-evidence-rape-accused-killing&quot;&gt;indeed the perpetrators of the crime&lt;/a&gt;, or scapegoats used by the police to assuage public anger. The constitutional duty of the police is to prevent crimes and investigate them, and it is these roles that it must perform in accordance with the law and the constitution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The description of the custodial killings as &ldquo;encounters&rdquo; is a thinly-veiled attempt by the Telangana police to claim legitimacy for their brazenly illegal acts. Under law, such deaths amount to the commission of the offence of murder, unless they fall in the exception of self-defence. There is no exception exclusively available to police.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The justification of encounters as a legitimate response to the maintenance of law and order is antithetical to the rule of law. In fact, the Supreme Court has considered such abuse of power by the police to be &ldquo;&lt;a href=&quot;https://indiankanoon.org/doc/158339934/&quot;&gt;state-sponsored terrorism&lt;/a&gt;&rdquo; and has issued detailed &lt;a href=&quot;https://indiankanoon.org/doc/25812914/&quot;&gt;guidelines&lt;/a&gt; on the investigation of such police encounters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also read:&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://thewire.in/rights/india-democracy-hyderabad-encounter&quot;&gt;India&rsquo;s Growing Impatience With Democracy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Killings in police custody have been particularly decried for their impact on the legitimacy of the legal system itself. For instance, in &lt;a href=&quot;https://indiankanoon.org/doc/501198/&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;D.K. Basu vs State of West Bengal&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the Supreme Court observed that:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;If the functionaries of the government become law breakers, it is bound to breed contempt for law and would encourage lawlessness and every man would have the tendency to become law unto himself, thereby leading to anarchism. No civilised nation can permit that to happen.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These custodial murders are not the only instance of abuse of power by the Telangana police. &lt;a href=&quot;https://thewire.in/rights/telangana-police-encounters-history&quot;&gt;Reports&lt;/a&gt; suggest that this appears to be a rehearsed pattern. In 2008, three men, accused of throwing acid on two 20-year-old women in Warangal, Andhra Pradesh, were killed in an &ldquo;encounter&rdquo; with a team led by the same police officer as in the present case. The parallels to this case are chilling &ndash; the victim had accused the police of not acting on a complaint filed by her almost three weeks before the acid attack. The police, who received a lot of criticism for not taking any action, were suddenly lauded as heroes after the &ldquo;encounter&rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does untrammelled police power prevent sexual assault?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The long fight against sexual assault in our country has highlighted the deep sexism and caste, religious and class prejudice that pervades investigating agencies. Allowing unrestrained power in the hands of the same police will not make the system easier for victims of sexual assault.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href=&quot;https://caravanmagazine.in/crime/gang-raped-filmed-blackmailed-murdered-long-tortured-road-unnao-rape-victim&quot;&gt;Unnao case&lt;/a&gt;, despite the legal mandate to expeditiously register FIRs in allegations of rape, an FIR was registered only after the victim approached courts to intervene. In the Hyderabad case, the family of the victim ran from pillar to post to get the missing person&rsquo;s complaint registered, to be met with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/hyd-rape-case-3-cops-suspended-for-delay-in-filing-fir-781455.html&quot;&gt;inaction and statements of victim blaming&lt;/a&gt; by the police. In the Kuldeep Sengar-Unnao rape case, the police have been instrumental in &lt;a href=&quot;https://thewire.in/video/watch-unnao-rape-victim-family-justice&quot;&gt;silencing the victim&lt;/a&gt; and shielding the BJP MLA who is accused of serious acts of gang rape. It is sobering to remember that the victim&rsquo;s own father was beaten to death in police custody. Similarly, the rape victim in the Chinmayanand case was &lt;a href=&quot;https://thewire.in/women/law-student-who-accused-bjp-leader-chinmayanand-of-rape-arrested&quot;&gt;arrested on charges of extortion&lt;/a&gt; after her allegations against the powerful BJP leader became public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In our attempt to ratify the so-called encounter in Telangana, we have forgotten the lapses of the police across the country in performing their primary duties. The police has exceeded the powers granted to it, abdicated the functions it ought to have performed and have now closed the case with a dangerous precedent &ndash; all the while claiming the moral upper-hand for themselves and their political masters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The history of the fight against sexual assault also shows the deep complicity between police violence and sexual assault. The first nationwide movement against sexual assault resulting in passage of the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 1983 was triggered by the custodial rapes of &lt;i&gt;Mathura&lt;/i&gt; (1972) and &lt;i&gt;Rameeza Bee&lt;/i&gt; (1978), both of whom were women from marginalised communities.&lt;/p&gt;', 0, '2019-12-08 21:57:09');
